# Heart_Disease_Analysis-using-EDA
### Project Description: Heart Disease Analysis Using Python EDA
#### Objective

The objective of this project is to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset related to heart disease to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights that can help in understanding the factors associated with heart disease. The analysis will involve data cleaning, feature exploration, and visualization to provide a comprehensive view of the dataset and its implications for heart health.
